**Ragul Vasudevan | Product Innovator in Blockchain & Web3 | Global Bitcoin Hackathon Winner 2024

I live and breathe blockchain. Over the last 4 years, I’ve immersed myself in the decentralized world, steering products from concept to market and reshaping how we think about finance. I thrive at the intersection of innovation, strategy, and execution—and I’ve got the numbers to back it up.

In 2024, I had the honor of winning the Global Bitcoin Hackathon, a turning point in my career that further solidified my passion for disrupting the norm. This win wasn’t just a trophy; it was the validation of years spent solving complex problems in decentralized finance and Web3.

As Co-founder and Product Strategist at BQ Labs, I’ve architected blockchain products that are not only technically sound but also market-aligned, attracting $85 million in TVL commitments through strategic partnerships with over 35 businesses. My expertise lies in taking big, bold ideas and turning them into functional, scalable solutions that make an impact.

Whether I’m leading a 15-member team, launching new DeFi platforms that boost assets by 250%, or creating user growth strategies that increase engagement by 300%, I’ve always been about pushing boundaries. From reducing transaction times by 25% to enhancing daily active users by 35%, I ensure every product I touch delivers tangible results.

But what really sets me apart? It’s not just my track record of success in DEX development or driving 200% liquidity growth—it’s my relentless pursuit of creating value in the decentralized space. Every decision I make is about driving impact, not just for companies but for the ecosystem at large.

On a mission to redefine the blockchain landscape, I’m always exploring what's next. If you’re building in blockchain, let’s connect and make something revolutionary happen.

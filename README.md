- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RagulVasudevan
- ðŸ‘€ I'm very much interested in Blockchain, QA engineering, RPA and Product management
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently writing smart contracts using Solidity and building Dapps

Currently working in a web 2.0 organization with working experience in RPA development (uipath,nintex) and extended experience in automation test engineering (selenium - java framework, performance testing - jmeter ,api and end -to-end testing).

I am also very much interested in finance and blockchain , so i have started my transitioning process into web 3.0 , I know solidity programming (web3.js, NFT, smart contracts ,hardhat, truffle, ganache) and and focusing to become a blockchain developer and blockchain test engineer.(since i have QA experience i want to inculpate that as well in blockchain).
